# 🧮 JavaScript Calculator

A clean, responsive calculator built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. This project is a fundamental practice in DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic UI/UX design. It handles chained operations, supports basic arithmetic, and includes error handling for divide-by-zero scenarios.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **HTML5** — semantic structure of the page  
- **CSS3** — custom styling, layout, and responsive design  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — logic for operations, event listeners, and user input handling  
- **Git & GitHub** — version control and live deployment via GitHub Pages

---

## ✨ Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: **Add**, **Subtract**, **Multiply**, **Divide**
- Chained calculations (e.g., `5 + 3 - 2 =`)
- Clear button to reset all input
- Prevents divide-by-zero errors with custom error display
- Fully responsive and styled in dark mode
- Clean and intuitive UI with hover effects for interactivity

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- DOM selection and manipulation with `querySelector` and `forEach`
- Handling user input and updating the display dynamically
- Using `parseFloat` and `.toFixed()` to manage decimal precision
- Managing application state with global variables
- Writing modular and reusable functions for cleaner logic

---

## ✅ Future Improvements

- Add support for decimal input and backspace/delete
- Add keyboard support for enhanced accessibility
- Improve mobile responsiveness further
- Enhance UI with animations or transitions
